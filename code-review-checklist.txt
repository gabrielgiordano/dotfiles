Code Review Checklist:

  Code Design:
    Is it Dry?

    Is everything at the same abstraction level?
      Does everything in it change at the same rate?
      
    How is the design at the logic level?

    Has few dependencies?
      It's using dependency injection?

    Single Responsability
      Does it have one responsability?

    Open Closed Principle
      Remove if's with polymorphism (Bonus: Why you should follow SRP!)

    Liskov Substitution Principle
      Design by Contract, respect class preconditions and postconditions

    Dependency Inversion Principle
      Does it depend on things that change less often than it does?

    Law of Demeter
      Ask for what you need, don't use thinks to get what you need
        Bonus: Why Service Locators/Context are bad: (Constructor that lies, depend on whole project)
